// TODO: Should this have functions that create other names that can build off of a schema name? They would return an instance of that struct type and they would then own their schema name so it is always used.
// I don't know enough about SQL to know if that would be good to help ensure that schema names are always used...
// This would also have the benefit of dropping the schemaName parameter from many function calls.
// Or would this impact readabilty too much?
// Maybe the other types should allow you to add a schema name to them? And if you already have then they just return self?
